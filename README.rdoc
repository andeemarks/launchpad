This gem provides a Ruby interface to access the {Novation Launchpad MK2}[https://global.novationmusic.com/launch/launchpad#] programmatically.  The code started life as a clone of {Thomas Jachman's gem}[https://github.com/thomasjachmann/launchpad] and was subsequently updated to handle the MK2 version of the Launchpad.  The mapping of buttons and specification of colours completely changed when the MK2 was released, so lots of the original code in these areas has been re-written, but the interaction code is still largely intact.

== More Info

* Novation's Launchpad MK2 MIDI programmer's reference {here}[https://global.novationmusic.com/sites/default/files/novation/downloads/10529/launchpad-mk2-programmers-reference-guide_0.pdf] was the sole source for helping me understand how to interact with the Launchpad.

* Due to limitations in the Portmidi gem, it's not possible to specify which channel is used to send MIDI messages.  As such, all interaction with the Launchpad are done over the default channel 1.  This means some workarounds have been needed to access functionality like flash and pulse, which usually require channel 2 messages.  All of these workarounds have been implemented via sending {System Exclusive messages}[http://electronicmusic.wikia.com/wiki/System_exclusive] as per the above reference guide.

== Requirements

* Roger B. Dannenberg's {portmidi library}[http://sourceforge.net/projects/portmedia/]
* Jan Krutisch's {portmidi gem}[http://github.com/halfbyte/portmidi]

== Compatibility

The gem is known to be compatible with the following ruby versions:

* MRI 2.3.1

== Installation

The gem is hosted on RubyGems[https://rubygems.org/], so in order to use it, you're gonna gem install it:

  gem install launchpad_mk2


== Usage

There are two main entry points:

* <code>require 'launchpad_mk2/device'</code>, providing <code>LaunchpadMk2::Device</code>, which handles all the basic input/output stuff
* <code>require 'launchpad_mk2/interaction'</code> or just 'launchpad_mk2', additionally providing <code>LaunchpadMk2::Interaction</code>, which lets you respond to actions (button presses/releases)

This is a simple example (only requiring the device for output) that resets the launchpad and then lights the grid button at position 4/4 (from bottom left of 0/0).

  require 'launchpad_mk2/device'
  
  device = LaunchpadMk2::Device.new
  sleep 1
  device.reset_all
  sleep 1
  device.change :grid, :x => 4, :y => 4, :color => 72

This is an interaction example lighting all grid buttons in red when pressed and keeping them lit.

  require 'launchpad_mk2'
  
  interaction = LaunchpadMk2::Interaction.new
  interaction.response_to(:grid, :down) do |interaction, action|
    interaction.device.change(:grid, action.merge(:color => 72))
  end
  interaction.response_to(:mixer, :down) do |interaction, action|
    interaction.stop
  end
  
  interaction.start


For more details, see the examples. examples/color_picker.rb is the most complex example with interaction.
